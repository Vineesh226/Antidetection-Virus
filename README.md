# Antidetection-Virus
It is a Malware or a similar thing which haves a potential to harm the user by not allowing them to type. It will interrupt the user's work by automatically sending keys. You have to restart your system further. It won't be detected by a Antivirus software as it is programmed to be similar to a malware but not actually a virus.
Either download the above file (virus.vbs) or copy the code in Notepad with extension (.vbs)

# How to implement?
For this you have to go through the following steps:

1) Save this file named virus.vbs or you can just copy the code written in virtual basic script and paste it into any text editor like notepad, must name the the extension as (.vbs)
2) Now copy this file to the startup folder in the windows of the victim.
3) Other thing we can do is giving it a default path into the windows startup folder through command prompt or by other methods like setting a default extract to a sepcific path.
4) Either the victim will run it than it will execute or otherwise it will start automatically while restart.

# How it works?

It is written in Virtual basic script. It is programmed or simply scripted to continuously loop to send keys automatically. It is saved as a Batch file which executes automatically and it won't let the user type or work. Whenever they will try to do so they will see a automated message on the screen automatically where they are supposed to type. There is delay of 100 milliseconds assigned to the loop.
